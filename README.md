## BLUEStandard
The standard by which BLUE evaluates all ERC20 tokens for participation in the BLUE Seal of Approval program
This format highly inspired by the Ethereum EIP contributor standard.

BLUE Improvement Proposals (BIPs) describe the standards by which we hold tokens, wallets, exchanges, and other blockchain actors to when assigning reputation in the BLUE ecosystem.
